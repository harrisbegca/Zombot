<h1 align="center">Zombot</h1>

<p align="center">
An application that uses markovian algorithms to model the browsing patterns of users to replicate "real user" patterns, thereby making it hard to detect "zombie" bots (or zombots).
<br/>
  <br/>
In other words, this project is an offshoot of selenium in order to make automated "bots" that can test not only your website but also the entirety of the internet.
<br/>
  <br/>
Besides that, if you technically wanted fake users on your site (not saying you should do this), this bot would be able to emulate human behaviour upon training.
